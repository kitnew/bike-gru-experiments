@article{Kaghazgaran2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Association for Computing Machinery. We propose a system called TwoFace to uncover crowdsourced review manipulators who target online review systems. A unique feature of TwoFace is its three-phase framework: (i) in the first phase, we intelligently sample actual evidence of manipulation (e.g., review manipulators) by exploiting low moderation crowdsourcing platforms that reveal evidence of strategic manipulation; (ii) we then propagate the suspiciousness of these seed users to identify similar users through a random walk over a "suspiciousness" graph; and (iii) finally, we uncover (hidden) distant users who serve structurally similar roles by mapping users into a low-dimensional embedding space that captures community structure. Altogether, the TwoFace system recovers 83{\%} to 93{\%} of all manipulators in a sample from Amazon of 38,590 reviewers, even when the system is seeded with only a few samples from malicious crowdsourcing sites.},
